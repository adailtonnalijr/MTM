# Wix: Website creating AI tool
*Analysis by Adailton Nali Junior | Electrical Engineer | Fall 2025*

## Tool Overview
- **Provider**: Wix
- **Pricing**: Free to use, paid to upload the website, get domains, and other features. 
- **Core Functionality**: Help users create websites from ideas, translating a paragraph into a working website.
- **Link**: www.wix.com

## My Testing Methodology
I started testing the tool by first doing the bare minimum and seeing the results, then I gradually started applying what I wanted to see what the difference was. I was curious to see how good the AI was, and how much it could do right of the bat vs just choosing a template. 

## Career-Relevant Use Cases
### Use Case 1: Engineering Startup Website
- **Context**: Creating a more engineering focused website
- **Process**: I gave very long descriptions of what I wanted, and let the tool make template and color scheme decisions. It automatically detected the fire idea, and it input images that made sense with the product
- **Output**: [What it produced - include screenshots]
- **Time Saved**: [Quantify efficiency gain]
- **Quality Assessment**: Very Good
  
### Use Case 2: Creating a clothing website similar to Nike's 
- **Context**: [What you were trying to accomplish]
- **Process**: [How you used the tool]
- **Output**: [What it produced - include screenshots]
- **Time Saved**: [Quantify efficiency gain]
- **Quality Assessment**: Very Good

### Use Case 3: Break Case
- **Context**: I was trying to test the limitations of the algorithm and see what it would happen if I put invalid inputs. 
- **Process**: I did not reply to the questions correctly, I just submitted symbols, letters, and words instead of descriptions of what I was trying to acocomplish.
- **Output**: [What it produced - include screenshots]
- **Time Saved**: N/A
- **Quality Assessment**: Bad. It created a website based on no inputs, which begs the question of how good is it really analyzing the inputs when I'm trying to build something for real.

## Failures & Limitations
### Failure 1: The AI does not filter out any input 
- **What I Tried**: I tried breaking the machine by using it the worst way possible. The website only allowed me to use text, to I tried the worst text inputs possible. The website simply guessed what I wanted. 
- **Why It Failed**: It created the website based on whatever it interpreted.
- **Screenshots**: [Evidence of failure]
- **Lesson Learned**: The program is very badly written, maybe because they never expected people to baheve this way.


## Skill Code Analysis
### Challenge
Zero challenge. Most users will use this tool only once during set up, and the point of it is to be as straight forward as possible.
### Complexity
The tool eliminates every nuance possible. It already asks you questions about the business to choose how to build the weh=bsite and features, leaving no room for questioning or margin for interpretation. It's a very guided experience, with clear formatted questions from the AI, different from other "sandbox" tools.
### Connection
Website building has been automated, and there's no need for a specialist to build your website. Of course it's nice to have someone that has used the tool before and knows what's needed ans what's not, but technically speacking no expert is needed.

## Bottom Line
**Who Should Use This**: Anyone trying to build a website.
**Who Should Avoid This**: Big corporations that require large scale processing and integration with other databases and programs.
**Hidden Costs**: Zero.
**My Verdict**: This tool is very useful to create websites fast and easy. If you just need a website to show your product and be professional then go ahead, but I wouldn't use it for anything complex.
