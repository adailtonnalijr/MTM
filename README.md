*Analysis by Adailton Nali Junior | Electrical Engineer | Fall 2025*

## Tool Overview
- **Provider**: Wix
- **Pricing**: Free to use; must pay to get domains, use premium features/APIs, and other features. 
- **Core Functionality**: Help users create websites from ideas, translating a paragraph into a working website.
- **Link**: www.wix.com

## My Testing Methodology
I had never created a website before, so I was curious to see how good of a job would the platform do compared to a big corporation, and what kind of information would the platform ask me to determine what would fit my needs. During the process, I wanted to understand how much would the AI fill in the blanks and determine what I wanted. So, I first tested the tools with simple answers, then after a while I saw what the tool as capable of and started givig our better prompts according to what the tool offered. I gradually described more what I wanted with better prompts, and got very good and accurate results after understanding what the AI wanted to know.

## Career-Relevant Use Cases
### Use Case 1: Engineering Startup Website
- **Context**: Creating a more engineering focused website.
- **Process**: I gave very long descriptions of what I wanted, and let the tool make template and color scheme decisions. It automatically detected the fire idea, and it input images that made sense with the product.
- [Inputs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YlPm8mZjLtT7rYFQAGr9s3VQjr7AD3wV?usp=share_link)
- **Output**: [Website](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mmqbOGxnxa8OQZXabpUERjFdT0-Zxpgs/view?usp=sharing)
- **Time Saved**: N/A
- **Quality Assessment**: Very Good
  
### Use Case 2: Creating a clothing website similar to Nike's 
- **Context**: Create a professional website that already has filters, pricing models, separate pages for each product, a cohesive color scheme with the company    
- **Process**: I gave as much description as I could about my product, asked for some features to be on the website (filters, being able to purchase, having different sections, etc.), and asked for a specific color scheme.
- [Inputs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/156Xh8PVq27ejUnzr8lUpDvH377hSNYdP?usp=sharing)
- **Output**: [Clothing Website](https://drive.google.com/file/d/104epz8Bwjlq5Zl-5iKRP9lqdcnmUFb3R/view?usp=share_link)
- **Time Saved**: N/A
- **Quality Assessment**: Very Good

### Use Case 3: Break Case
- **Context**: I was trying to test the limitations of the algorithm and see what it would happen if I put invalid inputs. 
- **Process**: I did not reply to the questions correctly, I just replied to the AI with the questions it gave me just to see what it would happen. Wuold it catch it, what would it say ? That is what I was trying to figure it out.
- [Inputs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TCQdefZnUyQ1EJyje-mDJkde8OIP-L12?usp=share_link)
- **Output**: [Broken Website](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19CUryEIP1KuVFqKfGI_0755JMB7c0_Vj/view?usp=sharing)
- **Time Saved**: N/A
- **Quality Assessment**: Bad. It created a website based on no inputs, which begs the question of how good is it really analyzing the inputs when I'm trying to build something for real.

## Failures & Limitations
### Failure 1: The AI does not filter out any input 
- **What I Tried**: I tried breaking the machine by using it the worst way possible. The website only allowed me to use text, to I tried the worst text inputs possible. The website simply guessed what I wanted. 
- **Why It Failed**: It created the website based on whatever it interpreted.
- **Screenshots**: [Evidence of failure](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Tti8pRttDCr05eFujE2ASOboqMb4Q9uO?usp=sharing)
- [Failed Output:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JPYxHV7J-TmMfgHCBWdNj0lF4AEuyKzQ/view?usp=sharing) 
- **Lesson Learned**: The program is very badly written, maybe because they never expected people to baheve this way.


## Skill Code Analysis
- **Challenge**: Zero challenge. Most users will use this tool only once during set up, and the point of it is to be as straight forward as possible.
- **Complexity**: The tool eliminates every nuance possible. It already asks you questions about the business to choose how to build the website and features, leaving no room for questioning or margin for interpretation. It's a very guided experience, with clear formatted questions from the AI, different from other "sandbox" tools.
- **Connection**: Website building has been automated, and there's no need for a specialist to build your website. Of course it's nice to have someone that has used the tool before and knows what's needed ans what's not, but technically speacking no expert is needed.

## Bottom Line
- **Who Should Use This**: Anyone trying to build a website.
- **Who Should Avoid This**: Big corporations that require large scale processing and integration with other databases and programs.
- **Hidden Costs**: Zero.
- **My Verdict**: This tool is very useful to create websites fast and easy. If you just need a website to show your product and be professional then go ahead, but I wouldn't use it for anything complex.
